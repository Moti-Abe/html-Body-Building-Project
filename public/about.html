<h1>About Me</h1> 
<p>My name is Moti Abe, a passionate and dedicated computer science student at Arsi University. 
I’ve successfully completed my second year and am now preparing to begin my third, with 
a growing enthusiasm for software development and emerging technologies. Throughout my 
academic journey, I’ve built a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and problem-solving
— essential pillars that support my goal of becoming a skilled software engineer. With each
semester, I’ve become more focused on turning theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world solutions.</p>
       
      
<p>Outside the lecture hall, I actively stay engaged with the tech world by exploring the latest tools, 
development practices, and innovations in software engineering. I’m particularly drawn to creating 
applications that solve meaningful problems and bring value to users. My learning doesn’t stop in the 
classroom — I consistently seek out tutorials, coding challenges, and side projects that sharpen my 
skills and help me grow as a developer. I believe that consistent effort, curiosity, and adaptability
are key to thriving in today’s fast-paced tech environment.</p> 
    
<p>When I’m not writing code, you’ll often find me in the gym. Fitness is more than a hobby — it's a way of life that fuels my discipline,
determination, and focus. I’m passionate about building muscle and maintaining a healthy body, and 
I see this commitment as an extension of the same drive that motivates my academic and career pursuits.
Whether it's pushing through a tough workout or solving a complex coding problem, I bring the same energy
and mindset to everything I do.</p>
